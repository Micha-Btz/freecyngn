A small tool to remove some proprietary parts from CyanogenMod.

freecyngn removes the following components which either contain or require
proprietary components of Google and which i personally don't like:

- BasicDreams

- CMFileManager
- CMWallpapers
- CyanogenSetupWizard

- Exchange2
- HoloSpiralWallpaper
- LivePicker
- LiveWallpapers
- LiveWallpapersPicker
- NoiseField
- PhaseBeam

## Usage
The script is designed to be placed in /system/addon.d so it will be run on every rom update!
